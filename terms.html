          creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of
          executing the release, which if known by him must have materially
          affected his settlement with the debtor." If you are a resident of
          another jurisdiction, you waive any comparable statute or doctrine.

          <strong>a. Agreement to Arbitrate</strong>
        </h4>
        <p>
          This Dispute Resolution by Binding Arbitration section is referred to
          in this Terms of Service as the "Arbitration Agreement." You agree
          that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise
          between you and Skya, whether arising out of or relating to this Terms
          of Service (including any alleged breach thereof), the Services, any
          advertising, any aspect of the relationship or transactions between
          us, shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding
          arbitration, rather than a court, in accordance with the terms of this
          Arbitration Agreement, except that you may assert individual claims in
          small claims court, if your claims qualify. Further, this Arbitration
          Agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention
          of federal, state, or local agencies, and such agencies can, if the
          law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf. You agree that, by
          entering into this Terms of Service, you and Skya are each waiving the
          right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. Your
          rights will be determined by a neutral arbitrator, not a judge or
          jury. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and
          enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.

              MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR
              PROCEEDING. UNLESS BOTH YOU AND SKYA AGREE OTHERWISE, THE
              ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S OR
              PARTY'S CLAIMS AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A
              CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING. ALSO, THE
              ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND

              MAY PURSUE A CLAIM FOR AND THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD PUBLIC
              INJUNCTIVE RELIEF UNDER APPLICABLE LAW TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED FOR
              THE ENFORCEABILITY OF THIS PROVISION.

          Notwithstanding any provision in this Terms of Service to the
          contrary, Skya agrees that if it makes any future change to this
          Arbitration Agreement (other than a change to the Notice Address)
          while you are a user of the Services, you may reject any such change
          by sending Skya written notice within thirty (30) calendar days of the
          change to the Notice Address provided above. By rejecting any future
          change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between
          us in accordance with the language of this Arbitration Agreement as of
          the date you first accepted these Terms of Service (or accepted any
          subsequent changes to these Terms of Service).

          You agree that Skya, in its sole discretion, may suspend or terminate
          your account (or any part thereof) or use of the Service and remove
          and discard any content within the Service, for any reason, including,
          without limitation, for lack of use or if Skya believes that you have
          violated or acted inconsistently with the letter or spirit of these
          Terms of Service. Any suspected fraudulent, abusive or illegal
          activity that may be grounds for termination of your use of Service,
          may be referred to appropriate law enforcement authorities. Skya may
          also in its sole discretion and at any time discontinue providing the
          Service, or any part thereof, with or without notice. You agree that
          any termination of your access to the Service under any provision of
          this Terms of Service may be effected without prior notice, and
          acknowledge and agree that Skya may immediately deactivate or delete
          your account and all related information and files in your account
          and/or bar any further access to such files or the Service. Further,
          you agree that Skya will not be liable to you or any third party for
          any termination of your access to the Service.

        <p>
          These Terms of Service constitute the entire agreement between you and
          Skya and govern your use of the Service, superseding any prior
          agreements between you and Skya with respect to the Service. You also
          may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when
          you use affiliate or third party services, third party content or
          third party software. The failure of Skya to exercise or enforce any
          right or provision of these Terms of Service will not constitute a
          waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of these Terms of
          Service is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid,
          the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give
          effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and
          the other provisions of these Terms of Service remain in full force
          and effect. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the
          contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to
          use of the Service or these Terms of Service must be filed within one
          (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever
          barred. A printed version of this agreement and of any notice given in
          electronic form will be admissible in judicial or administrative
          proceedings based upon or relating to this agreement to the same
          extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents
          and records originally generated and maintained in printed form. You
          may not assign this Terms of Service without the prior written consent
          of Skya, but Skya may assign, sublicense, or transfer any or all of
          its rights and obligations under this Terms of Service without
          restriction. The section titles in these Terms of Service are for
          convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. Notices to
          you may be made via either email or regular mail. The Service may also
          provide notices to you of changes to these Terms of Service or other
          matters by displaying notices or links to notices generally on the
          Service.
